## Levels of Care in the Continuum of Treatment

Sarah's recovery journey will likely involve multiple levels of care, as defined by the American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM) criteria. This continuum of care ensures that she receives the appropriate intensity of services as her needs change. Following her successful medical detoxification, Sarah transitions to a **Level 3.5, Clinically Managed High-Intensity Residential Treatment program**. This level of care is appropriate for Sarah due to her history of heavy alcohol use and the need for a structured and supportive environment to establish a foundation for her recovery.

In this 24-hour structured setting, Sarah will participate in individual and group therapy, psychoeducational groups, and skill-building activities. The criteria for transitioning between levels of care are based on Sarah's progress in meeting her treatment plan goals. For example, to move to a less intensive level of care, such as **Level 2.1, Intensive Outpatient Treatment (IOT)**, Sarah would need to demonstrate increased stability, a strong support system, and the ability to manage her cravings and triggers effectively. Conversely, if Sarah were to struggle significantly in a lower level of care, she might be moved to a higher level to ensure her safety and provide more intensive support.

As Sarah progresses, she may step down to **Level 1, Outpatient Services**, which involves fewer than 9 hours of weekly treatment. This would allow her to reintegrate into the community while still receiving support. Finally, **Level 0.5, Early Intervention**, may be utilized to provide education and support as she fully transitions back to her life, with a focus on relapse prevention and maintaining her recovery long-term.
